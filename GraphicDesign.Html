                        watched it for the first time recently. I used adobe Illustrator for the main illustration,
                        photoshop to make the background and In Design to put everything together.</p>

                        we had to read during high school. My first book cover took me the majority of the time I was
                        given for this project. I did this second design in the last few days but I actually ended up
                        liking it more than my first one. I created this one primarily in Illustrator and In Design.</p>
